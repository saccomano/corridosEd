This test site is a demonstration of viable workflows to transform printed music to digital formats for computer assisted analyais, while providing a simple interface for browsing the scores visually and aurally.

Music and text taken from _El corrido mexicano_, compiled and edited by Vicente T. Mendoza (1954).

Music was first entered manually into Sibelius, exported as MusicXML, then transformed to MEI so that it could be viewed and played in the browser with Verovio, a music notation engraving library that outputs the score as SVG as well as a MIDI stream.

While the original scores were entered by hand, they could easily have been digitized by currently available OCR packages. All other procedures were automated: export to XML, transform to MEI, generate HTML, display SVG, play MIDI stream.

The Jekyll template used to build this site, "Ed.", was specifically developed for use in minimal editions by [https://minicomp.github.io/ed/credits/](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/credits/)

Design adapted for MEI & Verovio: [Mark Saccomano](https://mss2221.github.io/saccomano/).
